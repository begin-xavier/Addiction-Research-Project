# Addiction-Research-Project
Repository for 2026 Data Science For Addiction Research Fellowship, research conducted by Xavier McFadden


Research Plan — Xavier McFadden
Data Science for Addiction Research Fellowship
Spring 2025


Topic

I want to look at prescription stimulant misuse (Adderall, Ritalin, etc.) among college students.
Being at Ole Miss I've seen how common this is, and I think there's a real gap between how normalized it is on campuses and how little attention it gets. I want to use data to actually look at the problem instead of just assuming things about it.


Research Questions

- How has stimulant misuse among college students changed over the past several years?
- Who is most likely to misuse — are there patterns by gender, race, income, etc.?
- Do students who misuse stimulants actually seek help, and if not, why not?


Data

I plan to use the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) public dataset from SAMHSA.
It's free, nationally representative, and has the variables I need. I'll focus on college-enrolled students aged 18-22 and look at data from around 2015 to 2022.


Analysis

I'm still learning data science but I know basic Python. My plan is to:
- Run descriptive statistics to look at prevalence over time
- Break the data down by demographics to find patterns
- Try a logistic regression to see what predicts misuse
- Look at treatment-seeking rates among those who misused

I'll need guidance on the more advanced parts, especially the regression, but I'm committed to learning as I go.


Paper Structure (targeting 7-8 pages)

1. Introduction — why this matters, my research questions
2. Literature Review — what's already been found
3. Methods — the dataset and what I did with it
4. Results — what I actually found, with a chart or two
5. Discussion — what it means, what the limitations are
6. Conclusion — key takeaways
7. References


Rough Timeline

February — get the dataset downloaded, start reading background literature
March — run the analysis, figure out what I actually have
April — write the paper, get feedback, revise
Early May — final edits and submit


What I'm hoping to get from this fellowship

Honestly I want to get better at working with real data and producing something meaningful.
I also want to understand what a career in data science can actually look like, because that's the direction I'm heading. This feels like a good place to start figuring that out.
